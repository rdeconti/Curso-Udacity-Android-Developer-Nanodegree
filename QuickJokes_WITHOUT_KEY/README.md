AdMob KEYS
    Sample ad units
    The quickest way to enable testing is to use Google-provided test ad units.
    These ad units are not associated with your AdMob account, so there's no risk of your account
    generating invalid traffic when using these ad units. Here are sample ad units that point to
    specific test creatives for each format: (Ad format / Sample ad unit ID)
    Banner
    ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111
